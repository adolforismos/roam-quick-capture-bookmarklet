## How to use

The bookmarklet uses the Mobile Quick Capture url integration (https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/07-02-2020).

You can highlight a line of paragraph on a webpage and click the bookmarklet. A window popup will show you the same UI than on a mobile. You can add as many highlights or bookmarks as you want. 

To sync and see the captured text and url in Roam, you have to reload your app. A message asking if you want to sync the captured text will show.

This bookmarlet is adapted from the Pinboard bookmarklet.
